# ⚙️ Hardware Engineering Repository

Welcome to the **Hardware Engineering** repository! This collection is dedicated to exploring, experimenting with, and building various hardware projects, from **ESP32 DevKits** to other versatile boards. Dive into the world of electronics with us and discover how different modules interact, communicate, and work together.

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

Each board project includes:
- **Hands-on Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides to help you set up, wire, and test hardware modules.
- **Code Examples**: Ready-to-run scripts and snippets for each module to get you up and running quickly.
- **Documentation**: Schematics, explanations, and tips to help you make the most of each component.

## 📚 Boards and Modules

This repository includes the following boards (with more to come!):

- **[ESP32 C6](esp32_c6/esp32_c6.md)**
    - Project includes the **nRF24L01** wireless module possibly for Jamming.
- **[ESP8266](esp8266/esp8266.md)**
  - Wi-Fi deauthentication and Fake Access Points 

These examples should only be used for **ethical, legal educational purposes**, such as **penetration testing in authorized environments**, **security research**, and **networking experiments** on **isolated or private networks**. It is important to **never** use these techniques on public networks or unauthorized systems.

> 🚀 Stay tuned as we add more boards, exciting modules, and features!
